    "# 1. Business Understanding\n",

    "## 1.1 Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Ocular diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Cataracts represent a significant and growing global health burden. These conditions are leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide. The key to preventing vision loss is early and accurate detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, diagnosis relies on a manual examination of retinal fundus images by highly trained ophthalmologists. This process, while effective, faces several critical challenges:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability & Accessibility:** There is a global shortage of ophthalmologists, particularly in remote and underserved regions. This creates a severe bottleneck, leading to long wait times for screenings and delayed diagnoses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-Consuming & Repetitive:** Manual screening is a time-intensive task that consumes a significant portion of a specialist's day, much of which is spent reviewing normal, healthy eye scans.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human Factor:** The diagnostic process is subject to human fatigue and inter-observer variability, which can lead to inconsistent or missed findings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence of deep learning, particularly in computer vision, and the increased availability of digital fundus imagery combined with patient metadata presents a transformative opportunity to address these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The current manual screening process for ocular diseases is inefficient, unscalable, and inaccessible to large parts of the population, leading to preventable vision loss due to late detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare providers require a tool that can automate the initial screening process. This tool must analyze a retinal fundus image and accurately identify the presence of multiple potential pathologies simultaneously, leveraging all available patient information for a more holistic assessment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses the need for an assistive tool by tackling this as a multi-label classification problem, where a single image can be flagged for one or more diseases, informed by patient demographics and comorbidities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop and deploy a proof-of-concept Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for ophthalmologists and general practitioners. This system will leverage a deep learning model that integrates Retinal Scan data with patient structured data (age, known medical history) to serve as an automated, first-pass screening tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific, measurable objectives are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **To Develop a Multi-Modal Model:** Build, train, and validate a fused model combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image analysis with a classifier for structured patient metadata (e.g., Age, Hypertension status). The model must accurately detect eight distinct ocular pathologies from a single fundus image and supporting data: Normal, Diabetes, Glaucoma, Cataract, Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Hypertension, Myopia, and Other abnormalities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **To Prioritize Triage:** The model will act as a triage assistant to help clinicians prioritize patient caseloads by flagging high-risk images for immediate review.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **To Enhance Efficiency:** Automate screening of healthy/normal scans to reduce manual review burden on specialists, allowing them to focus on complex diagnoses and treatment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **To Deploy an Accessible Tool:** Deploy the trained model as an interactive web application where users can upload retinal images and input patient features (age, comorbidities) to receive clear, probabilistic multi-label outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Business Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "This academic project will be evaluated on both its technical performance and practical utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Technical Metric (Multi-Modal Performance):** Mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) across all 8 classes, demonstrating the performance gain from incorporating structured patient data.  \n",
    "  - *Target:* Mean AUC-ROC \\( \\geq 0.90 \\) on the hold-out test set.  \n",
    "  - *Rationale:* Effectively measures the ability to distinguish positive and negative cases, even for rare classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secondary Technical Metric:** Per-class F1-Score, Precision, and Recall to transparently show performance on common vs. rare conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment & Utility Metric (Enhanced):** Successful deployment of a functional web-based application allowing users to upload fundus images and input mandatory metadata (age and at least one comorbidity like Hypertension) to receive a human-readable probabilistic output for all 8 disease categories, proving value as a CDSS.\n",
